Your "Writer's Toolkit" to automatically write blog posts and other content for your WordPress site…with zero effort!

== Description ==

The problem with creating your content for your WordPress site is that you can spend hours, days, weeks, months, or years working on it, and you never know if it will be good enough to get traffic to your site.

If you don't have time to create it yourself, and you're not willing to pay for someone to do it, how are you going to find a way to make the kind of content that will attract readers and viewers to your site?

Well, You don't have to be a pro writer to generate excellent content. You can use content generation AI (like GPT-3 or Jurassic-1) to write content for you and spend more time doing what you love and less editing and publishing.

With AI Mojo, now you can use state-of-the-art AI technology, like GPT-3 & Jurassic-1, to write the best copy or blog post for you... without any of the struggle of actually writing it.

Just tell the AI what you want, and it'll do the rest.

### HOW IT WORKS?

**NOTE:** This is a Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK) application, meaning you must have your own OpenAI / AI21 Studio API key to use this plugin.

1. You first need to sign up for an account at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com) or [AI21 Studio](https://studio.ai21.com) to get the API key for their AI engines (GPT-3 or Jurassic-1).

2. You'll need to insert the API key into AI Mojo to connect your WordPress site with the AI engine of your choice.

3. Once your site is connected, you can go to the post editor to generate content. Give the AI a simple instruction like "Write an article outline about (fill in the blank)." Or, "Write three headlines for (your topic)", and the AI will begin writing the content for you.

That's it!

To conclude the process, you read the content the AI has generated, make any minor tweaks you may need, and then publish it.

This is THE fastest way to create content from scratch!

### This plugin is free. 

You only need to pay for API calls to OpenAI / AI21 Studio. 

No more paying for the middle-man, and go directly to the source.

Try it out for yourself now.
